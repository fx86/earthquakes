Below are the sections that will help define the outline of the story of earthquakes.

## Quantity

This section highlights the sheer number of earthquakes i.e. how many earthquakes have occurred
on the planet - over the years.

## Where ?

This section flows from the above one highlighting the **worst hit** countries and **least hit** countries.
It will allow the user to concentrate on a specific region.

**Worst Hit - Formula**

A hit scale can be defined as: (for a selected time period)

hit = richter scale * population density * quantity of earthquakes 

## Worst hit over time

- How has this area affected over time ?
- Has this caused people to move out of the country ?
- How did it affect economy ?

## Let's look at worst hit countries

- How many earthquakes does this country see in a day, on average ?   _sure_
- Which were the worst among these and when did they occur ?          _sure_
- What might have caused the earthquake ?                             _maybe_

## Sidenotes
