# Earthquakes

----

Below are the sections that will help define the outline of the story of earthquakes.

## Quantity

This section highlights the sheer number of earthquakes i.e. how many earthquakes have occurred
on the planet - over the years.

## Possible structure

#### story-flow
    - Which continent sees the most earthquakes (north america):
      - (3) North, South, Central America
      - Europe
      - Asia
      - Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, littul littul islands)
    - What if we remove North America ?
    - Do continents with the largest surface area have the most quakes ?
    - Show how the quakes occured on a yearly basis across these continents
    - Going deeper into a continent shows countries within that continent which 
      - see most earthquakes per day
      - saw biggest earthquakes in the last century
      
      These dimensions could provide additional contrast to the information 
        - total populations. 
        - surface area
        - population density
        - earthquake counts
        - timelines across years

    - Now, that we know how which countries saw biggest quakes, 
      we can see what happened during the days before and after the big tremors. 

#### Where ?

This section flows from the above one highlighting the **worst hit** countries and **least hit** countries.
It will allow the user to concentrate on a specific region.

**Worst Hit - Formula**

A hit scale can be defined as: (for a selected time period)

hit = richter scale * population density * quantity of earthquakes 

#### Let's look at worst hit countries

This section can answer questions like:

- How has this area affected over time ?
- Has this caused people to move out of the country ?
- How did it affect economy ?
- How many earthquakes does this country see in a day, on average ?
- Which were the worst among these and when did they occur ?
- What might have caused the earthquake ?

#### Sidenotes

There are other insights that can be showcased which are not really connected to the above flow but
as additional, interesting facts. Like the **Did you know?** sections in encyclopedias.

- How are earthquakes majorly caused ?
- Any unique cause of an earthquake ? An explosion, or a meteorite collision ?
